Despite our best efforts, a new mutation of the deadly virus *Cucurbita purpureus* has made its appearance on the island. In addition to the slow decrease in health seen previously, various rapidly changing and unpredictable effects have been observed. A new **bar** has been added to the HUD to **track susceptibility to infection**. As before, all H.A.Z.E.L. personnel are ordered to evacuate as soon as possible.

Following the outbreak, three new facilities have been constructed on the island. The **Medical Camp** contains critical supplies for healing the infected, including the **Vaccinator**. The **Graveyard** serves as a final resting place for those who unfortunately succumbed to the infection, as well as the new home of the **Seedshot**.

Finally, the **Plumpkin Warehouse** houses two top-secret, highly experimental weapons: the powerful **M202-F plumpkin launcher**, and a few units of the **Sequential Explosive Ejection Device** (aka **S.E.E.D.**), a plumpkin-based explosive which can also be found less commonly throughout the map.
